    <a href="move.html">Stuffed City </a>
    <p>A stuffed city is a creation of a virtual environment soon to become a liveable place. A stuffed city consists of having building-size stuffed animals instead of what we see in our lives today. Take a moment to explore enjoy a new perspective of world-building. I want to be able to make the people feel like they are in a place that can not be true and to be able to enjoy and relax. Also, it is a nice environment to just feel the silence 
   <br><br> The environment was built of three.js working with multiple libraries like GLTFLoade.js to PointerLockControls.js to be able to create an environment we can navigate through. </p>
