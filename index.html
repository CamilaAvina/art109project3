    <h2>click above</h2>
    <p>A stuffed city is a creation of a virtual environment soon to become a liveable place. A stuffed city consists of having building-size stuffed animals instead of what we see in our lives today. Take a moment to explore enjoy a new perspective of world-building. I want to be able to make the people feel like they are in a place that can not be true and to be able to enjoy and relax. Also, it is a nice environment to just feel the silence 
   <br><br> The environment was built of three.js working with multiple libraries like GLTFLoade.js to PointerLockControls.js to be able to create an environment we can navigate through.Also use blender to be able to create my models and give it a soft texture or try to make is look like it there.  </p>
